## Description

This README generator is a command-line application that creates a professional README.md file for your repository. You can enter your project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license choice, GitHub username, and email address. The generated README.md file includes sections for Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions, with links in the Table of Contents to navigate to each section. The license choice adds a badge and explanation in the License section, and your GitHub username and email address are added in the Questions section.
